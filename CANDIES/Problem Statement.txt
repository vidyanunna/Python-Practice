
Problem Statement:
Let's consider a scenario where there are K candies to be distributed among N children, each uniquely numbered from 1 to N. The distribution commences with Child A, followed by a sequential allocation to the subsequent children in the order: A, A+ 1, A+2,..., N. The query at hand is to identify which child will be the last recipient of a candy.
In more explicit terms, after Child x (where 1<= x < N) receives a candy, the subsequent candy is granted to Child x+1. Upon Child N receiving a candy, the distribution cycle restarts. and Child 1 becomes the next recipient.
The primary objective is to ascertain the identity of the child who will receive the last candy in this cyclic distribution. Note: Each child receives only 1 candy.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains 3 space seperated integers N, K and A.
Output Format:
Print the friend who will be the final recipient of the candy.
Constraints:
