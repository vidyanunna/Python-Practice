
Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers, and your task is to write a function that finds the two numbers in the list that add up to a specific target sum. You need to retum the indices of these two numbers.
Write a function that takes a list of Integers and a target sum as input and returns a list of two indices (0-based) of the numbers that add up to the target sum. Assume that there is exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice
